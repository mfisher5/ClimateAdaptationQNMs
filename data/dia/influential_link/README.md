### Influential Links: Dia QNMs

QNMs created using the software Dia, to be read into R. 

Each adaptation strategy has three Dia objects: 

1. "Choose:" Switching targets. Not participating in the Dungeness crab fishery means shifting all effort to participate in other fisheries. 

2. "Wait:" Wait for crab. Not participating in the Dungeness crab fishery also means not participating in other fisheries.

3. "No Effect:" Participation in the Dungeness crab fishery does not affect participation in other fisheries.
